# Digital-Design_-ALU-


Designing and implementing a 3-bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that has inputs A & B to do
the following:
Operation Output (F)
2'S CMP F=A'+l
ADD F=A+B
SUB F=B-A
INC F=A+l
XOR F=A ^B
CMP F=B'
OR F=A|B
AND F=A&B

The ALU should also have the following output bits:
- Output bit V, where V = 1 in case of an overflow.
= Output bit Z, where Z = 1 if F = 0.
